## Geant4 nuclear process simulation library introduction

# ``EDX_measurements``

EDX measurements on a volcanic bomb where various minerals were separated 
while the melted rock was becoming solid.

# ``EDX``

Geant4 simulation of the X-ray spectra generated by illuming an AlFe
alloy target with electrons (simulated EDX measurements in a SEM).
Illustrates how to include low-energy physics and reduce the cutoff
energy to 150 eV for displaying the L transition lines.

# ``MuonCoincidence``

Two targets illuminated by a muon beam detect the particle in the time
interval needed for the particules propagating at the speed of light
to reach the two detectors. Illustrates how to timestamp events and 
extract their energy.
